## Background
*The Mutant* picks up where other projects like [gelatin][gelatin], [glucose][glucose] and
[odin][odin] left off. My goal is to bring back some of the cool features from
those failed projects and get them up and running again in a slightly new context.
The point of it all is to be able to quickly write portable video games and multimedia 
applications in Haskell.

*The Mutant* gets its name from its unapologetic use of in-place mutation, which
many Haskell devs fear. 

Don't fear The Mutant. 

Similarly, it "mutates" your game onto a 
number of target platforms - the name is a double entendre. It also lends itself to cool 
icons.

Don't fear The Mutant.
