# The Mutant
This is a collection of game related APIs (effects) and backends (interpreters).
It picks up where other projects like [gelatin][gelatin], [glucose][glucose] and
[odin][odin] left off. My goal is to bring back some of the cool features from
those failed projects and get them up and running again in a slightly new context.
The point of it all is to be able to quickly write portable games in Haskell.

`the-mutant` gets its name from its unapologetic use of in-place mutation, which
many Haskell devs fear. Don't fear The Mutant.
