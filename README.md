## Background
*The Mutant* picks up where other projects like [gelatin][gelatin], [glucose][glucose] and
[odin][odin] left off. My goal is to bring back some of the cool features from
those failed projects and get them up and running again in a slightly new context.
The point of it all is to be able to quickly write portable video games and multimedia 
applications in Haskell.

The Mutant gets its name from its unapologetic use of in-place mutation, which
many Haskell devs fear. Don't fear The Mutant. Similarly, it "mutates" your game onto a 
number of target platforms - the name is a double entendre. It also lends itself to cool 
icons.

Don't fear The Mutant.
